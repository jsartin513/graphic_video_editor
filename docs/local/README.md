# Local Documentation

This folder contains local documentation, helper scripts, and notes that are **not committed to the repository**.

## Purpose

Files in this directory are for local development, personal notes, and temporary documentation. They are ignored by git (see `.gitignore`).

## For Future Agents/AI Assistants

**Please put all local documentation, helper scripts, and temporary files in this `docs/local/` directory.**

Examples of files that should go here:
- Local setup notes
- Personal development guides
- Temporary review documents
- One-off helper scripts
- Certificate setup guides
- PR review summaries
- Any files that are useful locally but shouldn't be in the repo

## Current Contents

- `CODE_SIGNING_SETUP.md` - Guide for setting up code signing
- `GET_CERTIFICATE_STEPS.md` - Step-by-step certificate setup
- `PR_REVIEW_SUMMARY.md` - PR review analysis
- `check-signing-setup.js` - Helper script to verify signing setup
- `get-pr-details.js` - Script to fetch PR details from GitHub

## Note

If you create files that should be shared with the team, put them in `docs/` (not `docs/local/`). Only put files here that are for local use only.
